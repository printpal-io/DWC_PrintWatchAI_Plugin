## Usage
**Getting started with the plugin.**
  1. Go to the plugin tab by navigating the side panel **Plugins -> PrintWatch AI**
  2. Enable the plugin by clicking the **Enable Monitoring** button
  3. In the PrintWatch AI plugin page, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
  4. Obtain your API key and enter it into the **API key** field. Navigate to the [WebApp](https://app.printpal.io) and create a Free account:
      1. Click 'Sign Up'
      2. Enter desired credentials
      3. Verify account with code sent via email
      4. Log into the WebApp and navigate to **Account -> Settings** and copy the **API key** value. Paste this value into the **API key** field in the Duet plugin
  6. For the Webcam URL input, enter the HTTP url at which the static image of the IP camera can be found. If using [Motion](https://plugins.duet3d.com/plugins/MotionWebcamServerPlugin.html) to handle the webcam streaming,       this value will be: "http://<ip_address>:<port>/<camera_number>/current". If configured using default settings with the Motion Plugin, this will be:  "http://localhost:8081/0/current"


**Thresholds**
   
   There are two threshold setting values:
   - _Notification Threshold:_ this is the defectiveness value at which a notification will be sent to the user. The defectiveness value 
   - _Action Threshold:_ this is the defectiveness value at which an action (pause with m25) will be taken on behalf of the printer.


**Enabling Monitoring**

The plugin will begin actively monitoring the printer if:
- A print job is currently active
  
OR
- Test mode is enable. (Enable this by clicking the **Enable Test Mode** button in the top right corner or the Plugin page)


**Interpreting Results**

Navigate to the **Preview** tab on the PrintWatch AI plugin page to view the AI's bounding boxes overlayed on the webcam preview. Detections with a certain score value will be drawn boxed in _red_.

The **Defectiveness Level** is shown on a circular Gauge to the right of the camera preview. The Guage displays the level on a scale of 0 - 100. A score close to zero indicates that there are no defects detected in the current frame, where a larger value indicates that defects have been detected.

Each printer and configuration will have a different value at which defects are detected well at. Please refer [section 1.3.1 of the Configuration Guide](https://printpal.io/documentation/tuning-your-setup/#articleTOC_3) to properly setup the printer's AI.
